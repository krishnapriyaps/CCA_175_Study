Three locations to set configuration in spark

1) Spark properties :
	- control most application parameters,  and 
	- Set by using a SparkConf object, or through Java system properties.

2) Environment variables :  
	- can be used to set per-machine settings, such as the IP address, 
	- Set through conf/spark-env.sh script on each node.

3) Logging : 
	- Configured through log4j.properties.
