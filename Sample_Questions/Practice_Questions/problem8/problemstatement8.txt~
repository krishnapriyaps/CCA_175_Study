Problem8
You already have two tables (Hive) name "SAMPLE_07" and "SAMPLE_08" in a default schema. With following structure (both the tables have same structure).

code string
description string
total_emp int
salary int

Create another table named Employee100K2 in a Family schema, which has all the employees whose salary is >= 100000 from both the tables.

--Hive Query to create table
CREATE TABLE if not exists family.SAMPLE_07 (code string, description string,total_emp int, salary int) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';

CREATE TABLE if not exists family.SAMPLE_08 (code string, description string,total_emp int, salary int) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','

--LOAD DATA
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH "/home/cloudera/Study/cca_probalems/problem8/sampledataproblem8_t1.txt" INTO TABLE family.SAMPLE_07;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH "/home/cloudera/Study/cca_probalems/problem8/sampledataproblem8_t2.txt" INTO TABLE family.SAMPLE_08;

create table family.Employee100K2 AS select * from (select code,description,total_emp,salary from family.SAMPLE_07 where salary >= 100000 UNION ALL  select code,description,total_emp,salary from family.SAMPLE_08 where salary >= 100000) T
