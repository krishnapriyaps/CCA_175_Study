The CDH comes prepackaged with a log generating job. start_logs, stop_logs and tail_logs. Using these as an aid and provide a solution to below problem. The generated logs can be found at path /opt/gen_logs/logs/access.log  
1) run start_logs
2) write a flume configuration such that the logs generated by start_logs are dumped into HDFS at location /user/cloudera/problem7/step2. The channel should be non-durable and hence fastest in nature. The channel should be able to hold a maximum of 1000 messages and should commit after every 200 messages. 
3) Run the agent. 
4) confirm if logs are getting dumped to hdfs.  
5) run stop_logs.
